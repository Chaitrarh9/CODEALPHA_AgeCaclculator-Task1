# Codealpha Web Development Internship
It is a 3 months of internship provided by codealpha for gaining hands on experience.
## Task1 - AgeCalculator
  This HTML document creates a simple Age Calculator web application using JavaScript. Users input their birthdate through a date picker, triggering a function that calculates and displays their age in years, months, and days dynamically. The script ensures accurate calculations, considering leap years and varying month lengths. The design is clean and responsive, featuring a modern layout with a centered calculator. Additionally, the input field is restricted to dates before the current date, enhancing user experience and preventing future birthdate entries.
